# Ramachandran_Plots

This project uses protein structure data from two datasets, calculates the φ and ψ angles of its amino acid residues, generates Ramachandran plots, and compares the differences between them. Possible reasons for these differences are explored, and data filtering strategies are proposed so that the Ramachandran plot of the dataset_2 looks closer to that of the dataset_1. Other matters that should be considered are also discussed and the plots are well optimized.

Generally speaking, we can run all the code in sequence. But the code document is long. After completing the preparation work, we can run the parts that need debugging separately. For the parts that do not need debugging, we can click the **arrow** on the left to collapse them.
